# HORISEON

Horiseon is a multi-improvement software team focusing on factors such as SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.

## CODE NEEDING IMPROVING

title: no title for webpage
navbar: all links do not work (SEO link does not take action when clicked)
        no link connects to sidebar beginning (more services)
CSS file: multiple items are repetitive, can be condensed down for better sustainability
Content: only basic divs included, not efficient for complexity

## RESOLUTION

title: corrected to display Horiseon - SEO, ORM, and SMM
navbar: SEO linked to content location on page
        "More Services" link added to navbar that links to sidebar, "More Services" added to sidebar title
CSS:    CSS condensed down for sustainability (content-layout, benefit-lead, and benefit-id used to replace repetitive classes         and ID's)
Content: divs changed to nav, main, aside, and footer to show more specific code
Footer: footer h3 changed to h4 for more sequential order while using headings
